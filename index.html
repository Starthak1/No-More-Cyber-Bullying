            <h1>What It Is</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Cyberbullying is when someone uses technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. It happens on devices like smartphones, computers, tablets, and gaming systems. Cyberbullying hurts people, and in some cases is against the law. Sometimes cyberbullying can be easy to spot â€” for example, if somebody else shows you a text, comment, or post that is harsh, mean, or cruel. Other acts are less obvious, like posting someone's personal information, or using photos or videos that hurt or embarrass another person. Someone might make a fake account or screen name to harass another person online they may not know themselves, so you don't know who the bully is.

            <h3>Why Should You Avoid Cyberbullying?</h3>

In the last few years cyber bullying has received a lot of attention from the media, as well as from concerned adults and young people. Sometimes you need to think about how would you react if it happened to you.</p>

You have never met this person in your life, you don't know and they might be lying to you about everything they've said, what do you do? In this case you shouldn't respond and you should immediately tell a trusted adult who could be your parents, teacher or just anyone you trust.</p>

In this case many wouldn't tell on the person with worries of being called a snitch however the smart and obvious thing to do would be to tell a trusted adult again most likely a teacher.</p>

The best thing to do in this scenario is check their phone number with your father's from your previous phone and if they don't match then block the contact and do not go to the place they said in the message.</p>
